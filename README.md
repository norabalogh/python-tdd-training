# python-tdd-training
Test-driven development demo with python. 
Run tests from project root with following terminal command:
```python
 python -m unittest discover
```
Rules:
* Tests are written first and someone else writes the code that makes the tests green
* Unassigned issues are free to take
* If you are working on an issue, please assign it to yourself
* If you create a new issue please create the corresponding tests for it on a feature branch and write the branch name into the issue
* If someone is ready with the tested feature a pull request has to be sent against the master branch
* The pull request has to be merged by the author of the tests
* CI should be green before merge to master
